# Ted
Just another Discord bot made with Python.

# Dependencies
There's a Pipfile in this repository, so if you have Pipenv or a similar packaging tool, you should be able to install the dependencies automatically.

# Setup
Go to `settings.json` and enter your bot's token where it says `(insert token here)`. Change the prefix and any other settings if you want, then run `bot.py`.
