# Ted

Just another Discord bot made with Python.

## Dependencies

There's a Pipfile in this repository, so if you have Pipenv or a similar packaging tool, you should be able to install the dependencies automatically.

## Setup

Create a new file in the current directory named `settings.json`. This will contain all your settings for the bot.

It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "token": "insert token here",
  "prefix": "$",
}
```

`token` - Your bot's token

`prefix` - What character(s) should be used before commands
